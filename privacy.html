        <p id="section">SECTION 1 - WHAT DO WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION?</p>
        <p>When you create an account at our website, as part of using the services we provide, we collect the personal
            information you give us such as your name, address and email address.

            When you browse our website, we also automatically receive your computer’s internet protocol (IP) address in
            order to provide us with information that helps us learn about your browser and operating system.

            Email marketing (if applicable): With your permission, we may send you emails about our website, new
            services and other updates.
        </p>

        <p id="section">SECTION 2 - CONSENT</p>
        <p>How do you get my consent?</p>
        <p>When you provide us with personal information to create an account, add a client, create an invoice or
            cancel a subscription, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason
            only.</p>
        <p>If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you
            directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no.</p>
        <p>How do I withdraw my consent?</p>
        <p>If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you, for the
            continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at anytime, by contacting us at
            contact@invoicing247.com or mailing us at: 5700 Yonge Street Suite 200, Toronto ON, M2M 4K2, Canada</p>

        <p id="section">SECTION 3 - DISCLOSURE</p>
        <p>We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms of
            Service.</p>

        <p id="section">SECTION 4 - THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</p>
        <p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the
            extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.</p>
        <p>However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction
            processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them
            for your purchase-related transactions.</p>
        <p>For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in
            which your personal information will be handled by these providers.</p>
        <p>In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a
            different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves
            the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the
            jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.</p>
        <p>As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in
            the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to
            disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.</p>
        <p>Once you leave our website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer
            governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.</p>
        <p>Links</p>
        <p>When you click on links on our website, they may direct you away from our site. We are not responsible for
            the privacy practices of other sites and encourage you to read their privacy statements.</p>

        <p id="section">SECTION 5 - SECURITY</p>
        <p>To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and follow industry best practices to
            make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed.</p>
        <p>If you provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted using secure socket layer
            technology (SSL) and stored with a AES-256 encryption. Although no method of transmission over the Internet
            or electronic storage is 100% secure, we follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement additional generally
            accepted industry standards.</p>
